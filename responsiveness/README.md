# Responsive Web App

With this one I wanted to practice more responsive design. Below you will find key elements that I've learned here and also some screen shots.

## So...what I've learned?

- setup a new React project with Vite, having Typescript and Tailwind
- made a responsive navigation with tailwind
- (i am still learning:)) )
